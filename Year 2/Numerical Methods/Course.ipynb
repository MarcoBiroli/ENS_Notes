    "\n",
    "The goal of temporal discretization is to turn a differential equation into something the computer can solve numerically:\n",

    "\\frac{du}{dt} = f(u) ~~~~ u, f \\text{ in } \\mathcal{R}^N\n",
    "$$\n",
    "We start by presenting some easy standard first order approximation:\n",
    "## Forwards (Explicit) Euler:\n",
    "The forwards explicit euler consist in extrapolating previous data using a first order expansion:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "u^{FE} (t + \\Delta t) = u^{FE}(t) + \\Delta t f(u^{FE}(t))\n",

    "## Backwards (Implicit) Euler:\n",
    "The backward euler consists in solving the simplified first order expansion equation for $t$:\n",

    "We mentionned first order expansions however we haven't said what an expansion is. A taylor expansion is given as follows:\n",

    "First order methods are called first order because they match the first order expansion only up to the first term of the series expansion. Second order methods also exist the most famous being:\n",

We then need to compute an amplification factor $\\Phi(q)$ and for the solution to be stable we want $|\\Phi(q)| < 1$ and for it to be L-stable we want $|\\Phi(q)| \\to 0$ as $q \\to \\infty$. "
