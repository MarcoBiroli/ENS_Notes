This is a small python Library to solve any Gross Pitaevskii equation using the Crank Nicolson method. The files are organized as follows:

	- Quant: Contains the basic Wavefunction class to represent any given wavefunction along with some helpful methods.
	- methods: Contains for now only the Crank Nicolson solver method.
	- differentials: Contains an Operator class containing all useful differential operators
	- visualizer: Contains some basic plotting functions.
	- VortexPairs.py: An example code for the 2D vortex pair problem using the library.
	- HawkingRadiation.py: An example code for the 1D Hawking radiation problem using the library. 
	- Analyser.py: A simple cumulation of plotting and utilities functions.
